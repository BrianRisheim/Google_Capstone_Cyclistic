# Google_Capstone_Cyclistic

I formulated this case study to simulate the real-world tasks of a junior data analyst. This project will use the steps of data analysis process to answer key business questions.

The steps of the data analysis process in order are:

-   Ask
-   Prepare
-   Process
-   Analyze
-   Share
-   Act

Each step of the process will include:

-   Guiding questions about each phase and their respective answer
-   Key tasks about each phase
-   Output from key tasks
-   Code Snippets to display thought process (if applicable)

**Scenario:**

You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic ,a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company's future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

Cyclistic's marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

The director of marketing sets a goal to design marketing strategies aimed at converting causal riders into annual members. Management has tasked you to research findings based on how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently.

The raw data files were housed on my personal computer. I set up the file pathways appropriately to facilitate importing the data into RStudio for examination
